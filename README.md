Etherpad Lite for Django
========================

__This app is in a pre-alpha state - some assembly is required.__

This Django app provides a basic integration with etherpad lite. It presently allows django users created by the django.contrib.auth app to be mapped to etherpad users and groups, the creation of pads and secure sessions.

Patches, forks, questions and suggestions are always welcome.

Installation
------------

For now installation is all manual.

First you will need to [install etherpad-lite](http://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite/blob/master/README.md), or have the server url and apikey of an existing etherpad-lite instance.

Lets assume if you are looking at this you already know how to [install Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/intro/install/) and [start new Django projects](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/intro/tutorial01/). 

You will need to clone this repo into your Django project, and add `etherpadlite` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `settings.py`.

Finally you will need to add lines to your `urls.py` file. You can either add this line:

     url(r'^', include('etherpadlite.urls')),

Or, if you are already serving your home page via a different app, these lines:

     url(r'^etherpad', include('etherpadlite.urls')),
     url(r'^accounts/profile/$', include('etherpadlite.urls')),
     url(r'^logout$', include('etherpadlite.urls')),

Once you have done this, you will need to, at minimum, create a group and add a first etherpad-lite server via the django admin interface in order to take full advantage of this modules functionality:

1. Add a group: `admin/auth/group/add/`
2. Add an etherpad server: `admin/etherpadlite/padserver/add/`
3. Add an etherpad group corresponding to the auth group: `admin/etherpadlite/padgroup/add/`

At this point, any users you add to the django project who are members of an etherpad enabled group will be able to take full advantage of the modules features.

Etherpad-lite settings generation
---------------------------------

__WARNING__: This feature requires dict-style `settings.DATABASES` setting in your project.

`django-etherpad-lite` offers a management command which generates a `settings.json` for Etherpad-lite uses project's database configuration. It is then possible to generate a proper configuration using `python manage.py generate_etherpad_settings > /path/to/etherpad/configuration/settings.json` and then start Etherpad-lite using `-s` option: `node node/server.js -s settings.json`:

    $ python manage.py generate_etherpad_settings
    {
        "minify": true,
        "dbType": "postgres",
        "ip": "0.0.0.0",
        "maxAge": 21600000,
        "port": 9001,
        "loglevel": "INFO",
        "abiword": null,
        "defaultPadText": "",
        "dbSettings": {
            "host": "localhost",
            "password": "database_password",
            "user": "database_user",
            "database": "database_name"
        },
        "editOnly": false,
        "requireSession": false
    }

This configuration can be overriden by including a `ETHERPAD_CONFIGURATION` setting in your `settings.py`. Every option corresponds to an option in the Etherpad-lite default configuration. 

    ETHERPAD_CONFIGURATION = {
        'port': '8088'
    }

One exception is the database setting: while it's possible to override the `dbType` and `dbSettings` settings (e.g. if you prefer to use a real key-value store like Redis), for most use cases it's recommended to set the `databaseAlias` settings (which defaults to `default`) to let `django-etherpad-lite` extract and set database options from your project's settings:

    ETHERPAD_CONFIGURATION = {
        'databaseAlias': 'nondefault',
    }

Support
-------

Some documentation exists in the [github wiki](https://github.com/sfyn/django-etherpad-lite/wiki).

Report issues to the [issue queue](https://github.com/sfyn/django-etherpad-lite/issues).

A note on multi-server support
------------------------------

I intend to support multiple etherpad-lite services with this App. At present this functionality is untested. Use it at your own risk.
